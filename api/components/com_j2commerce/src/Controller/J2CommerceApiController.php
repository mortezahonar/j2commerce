 * Base API controller for J2Commerce.
 *
 * Forces 'Administrator' prefix for model resolution since J2Commerce
 * API controllers reuse admin models (no API-specific models exist).
 *
 * Also carries the authorisation every J2Commerce API route needs. ApiDispatcher overrides
 * dispatch() without calling checkAccess(), so there is no core.manage floor the way there is
 * on the admin surface, and ApiController::displayList()/displayItem() authorise nothing at
 * all. Without the gates below, any principal a merchant has granted core.login.api reads
 * every order, customer and address regardless of what j2commerce.vieworders says.
 *
 * Each subclass declares the capability its resource needs. The values mirror the admin
 * views over the same data — Orders and Customers gate on j2commerce.vieworders, Products on
 * j2commerce.viewproducts, and so on — so a merchant's existing permission setup means the
 * same thing on both surfaces.
 *
